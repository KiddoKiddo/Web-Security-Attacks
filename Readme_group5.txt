1) Please install Selenium package before running the scripts and we have used Firefox for testing.

2) Please keep all the bash scripts and python files in the same folder as we have given relative path in scripts.

3) We have followed the naming convention as per the table 1 given in the Assignment.

For example, if the bug catergory is Persistent XSS then it is 1(a) in table 1 and number of bugs are 2 so the name will be given as exploit1a-1.sh exploit1a-2.sh

4) For case 17, brute force attack is used so if the script is allowed to run and guess the password then it will take a lot of time hence, the correct password is entered on the 3rd attempt.
